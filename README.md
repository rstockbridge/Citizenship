# Citizenship

## Introduction

This is an Android app to help the user study for the US Citizenship test. (Note that the answers to some questions are specific to Michigan or Michigan's 11th Congressional District.)

Upon starting the app, the user can choose to practice a fixed number of questions, practice favorite questions only, or manage their list of favorite questions.

## Fixed Length Practices

The user can choose a short (10 questions), medium (25 questions), or full (all 100 questions) practice. The questions are randomly selected (10 and 25 questions) or in random order (100 questions). 

Each question appears as a flashcard. Initially, the answer is not shown. Pressing "Show Answer" will display the answer and allow the user to move on to the next question.

## Favorites Practices
